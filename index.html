  <h1>Will Eagle</h1>
  <p>
   Hi! I'm Will Eagle, an undergraduate Geology major, 2024 Udall Scholar, and Undergraduate Research Assistant in the 
    Jackson School of Geosciences at UT Austin. I'm primarily interested in issues related to water resources, and combine rigorous field studies with modeling and statistics
    to answer pressing questions about water resouces.
    Outside of research, much of my time is spent  working to build community with the Jackson School through the recently founded peer mentorship program.
    Oftentimes, my hobbies intersect with my research and coursework, as many of my weekends are spent galivanting in the Texas Hill Country, climbing, hiking, and caving.

  <h2>Texas Droughts — Dendrochronology and Ecohydrology</h2>
  <p>
   For the past few years I've been working on a research project in the Texas Hill Country working to use tree rings to reconstruct regional hydroclimate. 
    Going through the process of developing research questions, site selection, coring the trees, sample processing, and creating a lab space, has taught me a lot 
    about the scientific process and the ups and downs that come with it. It has been amazing to see how my research evolves. Most recently, I presented my results 
    so far at GSA Connects 2025. Since there aren't a lot of old trees in my study area, we have pivoted to evaluating the efficacy of the ring width drought proxy in
    these groundwater fed ecosystems.
